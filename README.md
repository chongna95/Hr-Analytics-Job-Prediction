# Hr Analytics Job Prediction

# Overview 
The goal of this project was to create a logistic regression or tree-based machine learning model to predict whether or not an employee will leave the company. This project utilized employee satisfaction levels taken from The HR department at Salifort Motors company. The final random forest model performed with 86% accuracy and 72% precision determining what features were most important in separating low tippers from high tippers. Based on the model, the duration, distance, and cost of the trip were most influential in determining a generous tipper (>20%) vs a non-generous one (<20%).
